ðŸ›  About the Project:
This is my passion project, designed to help me track and optimize my hard-earned stock investments.

The human mind, despite its brilliance, often struggles to recognize recurring patterns in data.

By tracking stock and options trades over specific time periods, this app enables me to:

  - Identify what's working and what's not.
  - Journal trades effectively.
  - Focus on high-probability trades while discarding the rest.
  - Monitor and maintain a comprehensive stock portfolio.
  - Whether you're a seasoned investor or a budding trader, this app provides a structured approach to refining your trading strategy.
