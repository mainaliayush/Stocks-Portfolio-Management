ðŸ›  About the Project:
This is my passion project, designed to help me track and optimize my hard-earned stock investments.

The human mind, despite its brilliance, often struggles to recognize recurring patterns in data. 
This app aims to bridge that gap by offering a solution to systematically store and analyze trading data. 
By tracking stock and options trades over specific time periods, this app enabled me to:

  - Journal trades effectively to identify what's working and what's not.
  - Focus on high-probability trades while discarding the rest.
  - Go full throttle on whatever works, but by strictly managing risk.
  - Monitor and maintain a comprehensive stock portfolio.

ðŸš€ Features
  - Trade Journaling: Record and review trades with ease.
  - Data Insights: Analyze trends and performance over time.
  - Portfolio Management: Keep tabs on your stock portfolio in one place.
  - Optimization Focus: Prioritize trades with higher probability rates.
